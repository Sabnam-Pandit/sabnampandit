#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a graduate student in the Big Data Analytics program at San Diego State University. Before this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, followed by an MBA-IT. My professional journey includes nearly a year of valuable experience working as a QA Engineer in the Fintech industry.

My passion for problem-solving has been a constant throughout my academic journey and my brief stint in the corporate world. This passion has led me to develop a keen interest in data and the data-driven landscape, where I recognize the pivotal role data plays in today's world. I consider myself a naturally curious individual with a solid foundation in technical skills. I am well-versed in the latest technology trends, possess strong programming skills, and am proficient in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

I intend to build a career in data science, where I can leverage my skills and curiosity to uncover valuable insights from data. I am excited about the opportunities to contribute to this field and make a meaningful impact through data-driven solutions.
