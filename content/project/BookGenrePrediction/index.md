This project focuses on predicting the genre of a book based on its description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to help readers find books they are more likely to enjoy by accurately classifying books into their respective genres. We fine-tuned multiple pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) to achieve this task.
