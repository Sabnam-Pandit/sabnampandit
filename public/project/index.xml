      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/bookgenreprediction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on predicting the genre of a book based on its description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to help readers find books they are more likely to enjoy by accurately classifying books into their respective genres. We fine-tuned multiple pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) to achieve this task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the History of Unemployment Rates in the United States</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/project/timeseries/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/timeseries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project explores the historical unemployment rates in the United States using time series forecasting techniques. The analysis focuses on state-specific trends, gender-based unemployment rates, and overall unemployment trends. The goal is to identify patterns, seasonality, and factors influencing unemployment, and to forecast future unemployment rates using ARIMA and SARIMA models.Statistical algorithms were utilized to make short- term and long-term
predictions. This analysis is crucial as unemployment rates are key economic indicators that
directly impact policymaking, business planning, and personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
